Brief Description of Project -

This application allows users to create budgets and track expenses related to their monthly income 
and will give a better solution for the users to keep track of their finances and make informed 
decisions about their spending. Not Only that the app allows users to input their income and 
expenses, create a budget etc. So, this application will give the users a better solution during this 
current economic crisis in the Country.

So, as our second year second semester Mobile Application Development project, we are going to 
introduce and develop a mobile application named “WalletWizard”. This program solves the 
above-mentioned real-life problems by providing a simple, user-friendly interface for managing 
daily life and making things easier. Any person can download this application and utilize it.
As the majority of individuals struggle to manage their monthly money effectively because they 
are unaware of their spending, income, and debts, we made the decision to launch this app. As 
most individuals have smartphones, they may use this software to calculate their costs, earnings, 
and obligations as well as handle their monthly payments with ease.

There are four main functionalities we identified in this system.
#### Income Management
#### Expenses Management
#### Debt Management
#### Shopping List Management
